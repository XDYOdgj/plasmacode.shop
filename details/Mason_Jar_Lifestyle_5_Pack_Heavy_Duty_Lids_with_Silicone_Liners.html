	var commentsList = [{"user":"George","content":"These are excellent stainless steel lids, and with the seals you can turn them upside down with water in them and it won't leak out. I use them to keep food fresh in the refrigerator, to ferment chile sauce, to store dry goods (like dry chiles), to keep dust and stuff out of my water (when I drink from a jar), to replace my airlock lids for ferments that use an airlock when they go in the refrigerator, etc. They're tight enough to prevent my ferments from smelling up the refrigerator and fermenting other stuff in it (I tried storing lacto-fermented pickles in the refrigerator with just my silicone airlock lids and metal bands, first, and I wasn't entirely happy with the result; the milk tasted weird; the watermelon became acidic; the refrigerator smelled). So, I got these! With these lids, I don't have weird refrigerator issues; it's all kept in the glass jars (yes, they need to be glass: bacteria can apparently go through plastic).If you don't have a seal on the regular mouth ones, it lets enough air in for at least one kind of insect to survive in it for at least two days (if you need that); so, there's not an immediate need for holes. It's not enough air to prevent humidity build-up, however. I'm not sure if the same is true for the wide mouth ones, although I've used the wide mouth ones more for every other purpose.The lids and seals are easy to wash. You can even boil them both if you want to (although boiling may get mineral deposits on things). One caution, though: sometimes when washing, a cloth, dish wand, or some such might get caught a bit where the steel curls around the rim, but it's easily avoided when you realize what's happening. It's not obvious that something can get caught in it just by looking at and handling it; so, it surprised me and it took me a while to realize how and where it was getting caught.I had a good experience with the seller when I communicated with them about a duplicate order I received.I've ordered three times (five sets of five wide-mouth lids, and one set of five small-mouth lids). I've mostly ordered wide-mouth lids, but I got some regular mouth lids, too. They're similar. The silicone seals look different, but they still work.Make sure others in the house know what they are and what they're for (and that the seals are very important and re-usable).The lids seem to indeed be stainless steel. No rust problems so far.","purchase_model":"Size: Wide Mouth Size: Wide Mouth  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2017-10-13 17:49:17"},{"user":"Francesca","content":"These lids are fantastic...exactly what I was looking for. I try to buy my glass second hand but usually they don't come with a lid or if they do the lid is pretty grotty or rusty. I was also sick to death of having the lid be two parts...all I wanted was a proper good quality lid that I can put on my large mason jars for my protein and fruit shakes. This product fulfils my needs perfectly. They came in a pack of 6 so there are plenty to go around. I have some in the freezer and some in the fridge...and others fermenting Vegetables on the bench. Each lid comes with a silicone seal to ensure absolute freshness. I always make sure though after washing these lids that they are dried thoroughly as these are not cheap but will last the test of time if properly looked after. I will be taking these back to Australia with me as I love them so much. They look great too...so aesthetically appealing is another plus for this product","purchase_model":"Size: Wide Mouth Size: Wide Mouth  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2016-05-17 17:49:17"},{"user":"Steven Tammen","content":"These things are great. The silicon ring stays in reasonably well (and doesn't bunch up noticeably when you tighten the lid), and everything washes up quite nicely. The assembly also appears to resist picking up smells, which is good.In terms of things to be improved, the stainless steel is a bit thin. Not flimsy, mind you, but not quite as thick as what I had envisioned. I think for most people, having a slightly heavier beefier lid would be worth the possible tradeoffs in weight and size. (On the other hand, I don't think it's going to affect the durability much... but why not?). These are also more expensive than I would like, but there don't seem to be many other good options (and they are certainly much better than the plastic-coated-rusty-tin lids that come standard on jars).I plan on carrying salads and whatnot around with these for lunch, so I will update this review later once I have a better idea of durability. I don't think there should be any problems, but time will tell.","purchase_model":"Size: Wide Mouth Size: Wide Mouth  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2017-01-26 17:49:17"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"These are very high quality and look like they are going to last forever.I am a mechanical design engineer and I bought these to use on a development project.So I did not buy these for the normal purpose of food storage but I'm sure they would work great for that.(I needed a one piece lid that I could modify.)The gasket mates well with the lid and doesn't fall out, but is easy to remove for cleaning.The thread engagement looks a little better than the standard lids with rings that I have to compare.So the design seems to be optimized by someone who knew what they were doing.(I'm using a standard wide mouth canning jar obtained elsewhere.)The gasket is solid (some grade of silicone, I believe) not applied/bonded foam like on the standard lids.So it shouldn't absorb anything from contents like I've experienced with the standard lids, if you are sensitive to that for re-use.The stainless steel shouldn't rust (except in the most extreme conditions!), whereas standard lids are plated carbon steel and can eventually rust, depending on your environment.So, barring inadvertent damage, I'd expect these parts to last indefinitely.One more thing to be aware of, that is different than the standard 2-piece lids:When tightening the ring on a standard 2-piece lid the ring slides on the top of the lid with metal to metal contact which is fairly slippery, and the lid doesn't rotate.However with these 1-piece lids the gasket rotates with the lid and slides on the glass rim during tightening.So it feels different, slower, the silicone has much higher (almost \"grabbing\") friction on the glass rim, but it does still slide as you maintain pressure for an extra second or two.So I find myself being a little more deliberate when I tighten it (because i need a good seal, so depending on the seal you need).I have never had the gasket buckle, roll, or fail... doubting that's even possible (without complete abuse)... just noting the difference.As an aside - note that the top of the glass rim is made very smooth and flat, with rounded edges.If that gets chipped it may either prevent a complete seal or more importantly cut and ruin your gasket.And for longer term storage make sure the seal joint is free of debris (food) to prevent any leak paths and achieve an effective seal.Happy canning!","purchase_model":"Size: Wide Mouth Size: Wide Mouth  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2016-04-15 17:49:17"},{"user":"Maria","content":"I have really gotten into mason jars in the past few years. It is important to me to be able to store food for my family in a clean air tight container in the frig or freezer. These stainless steel lids have a separate silicone liner. They are totally air & liquid tight. The bonus to this is they look so good & will last forever. For the holiday I make home made goodies and put them in quart size jars with these lids. I usually use aqua jars. I give them as gifts. To be honest I think they like the jar & lid better than what is inside. You will love them. I know I do!","purchase_model":"Size: Wide Mouth Size: Wide Mouth  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2019-08-24 17:49:17"},{"user":"Andrea Rose","content":"Unofficially, I would give these lids 4 stars though only because I miss the original colorful plastic and silicone version.Officially, I gave them 5 stars because standing alone, these lids are a great product and I would absolutely recommend. But again, for what it's worth, I would love to see MJL to bring back the colorful wide mouth jar toppers. :)","purchase_model":"Size: Wide Mouth Size: Wide Mouth  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-06-10 17:49:17"},{"user":"Beth S","content":"I use my old canning jars as food storage for leftovers too- now I can throw the lids in the dishwasher and pull them out bright and sparkly with-out rust and reuse them: excellent!","purchase_model":"Size: Wide Mouth Size: Wide Mouth  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-09-02 17:49:17"},{"user":"Bill H","content":"I purchased three different brands of lids from Amazon to use for homemade \"Board Butter\" filled jars, a combination of Bees Wax and oil to protect wooden cutting boards. These particular lids went on the easiest and thus worked best for me. The others could be cantankerous to get on and could unexpectedly pop off so extra care was needed when tightening. Those that worked best were also heavier duty and less flexible than standard lids and had a very heavy duty silicone gasket which I think most would like. The only downside for me was the price and stamped decoration which I felt was slightly less attractive. I have given a couple of jars away for gifts and thought the plain lid was nicer for that application.Having said that I intend to buy this particular product again. While initially expensive these things will hopefully last for decades.Sept 2019 - I ran across my review so I thought to add a quick update.These lids are holding up very well.So well I rinsed one off and it looked like new.This makes the price paid appear to be a bargain as I now expect to get years of service from these items.","purchase_model":"Size: Wide Mouth Size: Wide Mouth  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2019-03-22 17:49:17"},{"user":"10burgers","content":"I have ten of these, have used them over the last year for many types of food products - liquids and solids. They work very well. One has to remember to put the correct side of the gasket facing into the lid surface. The ridge on the rubber gasket must mate up against the lid surface. If you put it on the other way it will work, just not as well. I like these better than plastic as I do not like plastic, prefer glass or stainless for my food products. I also do not like using a standard two-piece lid as it is not as fast nor convenient to fumble about with the ring and separate lid. I like the one-piece concept, although one could say that the gasket makes it two piece. These do not rust like normal rings, which I like. Finally, Mason Jar service is wonderful. They are fast, very service oriented, and very polite. In fact they were so polite and good I looked into what else they sell, and am now buying additional items from them.","purchase_model":"Size: Wide Mouth Size: Wide Mouth  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2017-10-08 17:49:17"},{"user":"Placeholder","content":"I use various sizes mason jars for storage of everything.
